# Library Management System
This repository contains the source code for a Library Management System, developed as a homework project for the Computer Engineering program at Amirkabir University.

# Overview
The Library Management System is designed to efficiently manage the operations of a library, including tasks such as adding and removing books, managing borrower information, tracking book availability, and generating reports. The system aims to automate various processes involved in library management, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy.
